# Hatsukoi is a set of barebones tools written with Lua.
It runs on [Löve](http://love2d.org/), and is what I would consider the bare minimum of tools that any game will use. This is because it exists primarily for my use in game jamming!

# If you've stumbled across this, feel free to play around with it- but know it's not exactly full-featured.
This is a tiny personal project born out of a curiosity, and is mainly for my personal use in game jams. It's not named Hatsukoi (初恋) because it's something permanent, made for other people to use- this is something of a prototype; a first foray into Löve and game engine ideas in general.

# Things it does out of the box
* Objects with animated sprites
* Real and Virtual inputs for event handling
* Maps (tiles, scrolling [or not])

# Planned functionality (c. 2019)
* Simple UI tools
* Standard library of functions for classic game types + systems
* Examples
