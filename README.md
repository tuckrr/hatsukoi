# Hatsukoi is a barebones engine made with Lua.
It runs on [Löve](http://love2d.org/), and does very little at the moment. It's definitely not useless though, which is nice.

# If you've stumbled across this, feel free to play around with it- but don't expect much.
This is a tiny personal project born out of a curiosity, and shouldn't be seen as anything particularly serious. It's not called Hatsukoi (初恋) because it's something permanent made for other people to use- this is something of a prototype; a first foray into Lua, Löve, and game engine ideas in general.

# Things it does out of the box
* Animated sprites
* Real and Virtual inputs for event handling
* Maps (tiles, scrolling [or not])

# Planned functionality
* Simple UI tools
* Standard library of functions for classic game types + systems
* Import maps from (simpler) files
